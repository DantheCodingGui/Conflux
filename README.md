My Final A level Project, a top-down python game. 

Brief was to create anything I wanted, so I chose a game. Throughout a typical school year, also studying 3 other subjects I went through the process of gathering requirements, designing, implementing then testing a product.

In addition, my project was the first in the school's history to get full marks.
